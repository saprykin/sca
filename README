 ======= About SCALib =======
 SCALib stands for Sky Computing Algorithms Library. It can be used to
 calculate position of the star, Sun, Moon or any planet for given instance of
 time. The main purpose is to provide data for sky observations from the
 Earth. Calculation accuracy is not greater than 1 arcsecond, but it
 would be enough for almost all purposes. Most of the algorithms were
 taken from the "Astronomical algorithms" by J. Meeus.

 ======= Features =======
 * Angles handling
 * Coordinate systems transformations
 * Calendar routines
 * Calculates Sun position
 * Calculates Moon position
 * Calculates stars positions
 * Calculates planets positions

 Library has extemsive Doxygen powered documentation with a lot of examples.
 
 ======= Building =======
 Use CMake to build SCALib for target platform.
